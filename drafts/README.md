# Drafts & Scraps
Part of the project we might reference in the future, but they are not current working parts of the site.

Log written by Mary

hBase.html & sidebarTemplate.html => combined into base.html with Flask template formatting

hPage.html => edited into index.html

theArray.py => Start up Flask file before app.py was finished

database.html => Unsure of what this is meant to be other than just a copy of hPage.html. Moving it to drafts just in case someone needs it so it doesn't clutter the root folder.
